# Sudoku-solver

This is a program which solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. Written completely in C++ and built wholly from scratch, this program reads input from a file containing the Sudoku values and solves the puzzle. It employs concepts such as backtracking and recursion.
We are required to input the whole 9x9 sudoku in input.txt file with blank spaces as 0 and no spaces between number in a row.
Then we have to run our code and solved sudoku will be printed in output.txt file.
